      PIXEL is a modern art festival celebrating digital art forms such as video art, motion graphics, generative graphics, and interactive projections. Over the course of a weekend, we present three unique artists—one each day—in the same exhibition space, with the display transforming daily. The digital nature of the artworks allows for seamless transitions, offering a fresh experience every day.

      Alongside the main exhibitions, we showcase submitted works from digital artists across the country in a special exhibition accessible throughout the entire weekend. Visitors are invited to explore the diversity of digital art and experience how technology and creativity merge into a unified expression.
